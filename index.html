      <p>My name is Viktoria Haghani. I typically go by Viki, and my pronouns are she/her(s). I am a Postdoctoral Scholar with my PhD in Integrative Genetics and Genomics at UC Davis. I am co-mentored by Dr. Janine LaSalle and Dr. Julian Halmai, where my primary focus is applying bioinformatics tools to large sequencing data sets to answer biological questions. I really enjoy automating data analysis pipelines and writing scripts. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, baking, camping, doing puzzles, painting, playing video games, and lounging with my pet leopard gecko, Zoscia, and my pet parakeets.</p>
